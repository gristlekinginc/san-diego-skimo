            "We" are one dude who thought it would be fun to train for a skimo race while living in San Diego. It started in late spring of 2024, with an ascent of San Gorgonio. There was still plenty of snow on top, and coming down on micro-spikes was a lot slower than I could have skiied it.

            I got home and researched skimo training, settling on roller skis as the best option. I bought a pair of Marwe from a website in Germany, bought enough pads to cover damn near every inch of exposed skin and set about learning to roller ski. My plans were slowed dramatically after a double heel bone bruise injury that stopped me from doing much more than walk to my car for a month.

            Finally, in early December of 2024, I could get back on the Marwes and slowly start getting back into shape. The only hill nearby that's skiable is the obnoxiously loud bike path by the 15, from Mission Valley up to Adams. I started training on it and thought it'd be useful to have others to train with, so I built this website.

            It pulls in any of my Strava workouts labeled "roller-ski", and with a bit of nerd-work it can pull in yours too.
